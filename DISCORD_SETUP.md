# Discord Webhook Integration

Automatically post your kills to Discord!

## Setup Instructions

### Simple 2-Step Setup

1. Open **Game Log Monitor**
2. In the **Discord Integration** section, check **"Enable Discord Webhook (post only when I kill someone)"**

**That's it!** The webhook is pre-configured for your server. Just enable it and your kills will automatically post to Discord!

### Start Monitoring

Once enabled, **only your kills are posted to Discord in real-time**. When you kill another player, it will automatically post to Discord. Your own deaths are NOT posted.

## Features

### Real-Time Kill Notifications

When monitoring is active and Discord webhook is enabled, each time **you kill someone**, it's automatically posted to Discord with:

- üéÆ **Victim name** (who you killed)
- ‚öîÔ∏è **Your name** (the killer)
- üî´ **Weapon used** (with friendly name)
- üí• **Damage type**
- üìç **Location** (ship/zone name)
- üïê **Timestamp**

**Important:** Only posts when **you are the killer**. Your own deaths are not posted to Discord.

### Rich Embeds

Messages are formatted as Discord embeds with:
- **Color coding**:
  - üî¥ Red: Killed by another player
  - üü† Orange: Suicide/self-inflicted
  - ‚ö´ Gray: Unknown killer
- **Organized fields** for easy reading
- **Icons** for quick identification

## Rate Limiting

To comply with Discord's API limits:
- Messages are sent with a **2-second delay** between each
- Maximum 30 messages per minute
- This ensures reliable delivery without hitting Discord rate limits

## Example Discord Message

```
‚ò†Ô∏è Death Record

EnemyPlayer was killed by Voisys

üî´ Weapon: Scourge Railgun
üí• Damage Type: Ballistic
üìç Location: Aegis Gladius

Today at 3:45 PM
```

**Note:** This message appears when **you (Voisys) killed EnemyPlayer**. If you died, no message is posted.

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to send: 404"
- The Discord webhook may have been deleted on the Discord server
- Contact the server administrator to verify the webhook still exists

### "Network error"
- Check your internet connection
- Discord may be temporarily unavailable
- Restart the application and try again

### No messages appearing when I kill someone
- Verify the **"Enable Discord Webhook"** checkbox is checked in the main window
- **Check that your account name is detected** (should show at top: "Account: YourName")
  - If it shows "Account: Not detected", the app can't identify your kills
  - Make sure the game log contains your character login
- Check that monitoring is active (button should say "Stop Monitoring")
- Verify kill events are being detected (they should appear in the overlay)
- Check the console for debug messages showing: `[Discord] Posting kill: YourName killed VictimName`
  - If you see `[Debug] Skipping Discord - Killer: X, Victim: Y`, it means you weren't the killer
- **Remember:** Only YOUR kills are posted, not when you die
